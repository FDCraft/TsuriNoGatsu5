## TSNG 5.2.2

- Common Mods Add:
  - mystias izakaya
- Common Mods Remove:
  - Steam (Incompatable with kuayue)
- Recipes Change: 
  - Dirt

> In Vanilla, a long-winded process is used to get dirt: stone -> moss block -> rooted dirt -> dirt path -> dirt. This process is too difficult for those who did not have experience of Technique Survival. 
>
> Because nothing is input in this way (In the process moss block is changed to rooted dirt you also get oak logs, which could craft stone shovel), so we set the recipe of dirt as 4 moss block.

    - The armor and toughness of Majo's Hat and Cloth have been imporved significantly
    - Majo's Hat: 3 A 0 T -> 6 A 10 T
    - Majo's Cloth: 5 A 0 T -> 10 A 10 T

  > Accounting the experience of TSNG 4, Majo's broom is a efficient way of long-term travelling even in the last phase game; but the Majo's Hat and Cloth are so weak that we had to change the armors frequently to gain a full speed, thus this version the armor and toughness have been improved significantly to suit the last phase game.
